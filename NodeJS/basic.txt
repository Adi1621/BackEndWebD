With the help of NodeJS
-You can run JS outside of the browser
-JS can talk to native machine because of C++

Node JS Architecture

-Client makes a request to a server
-All requests queue in Event Queue
-All requests goes through Event Loop
Event Loop-Watcher on queue and takes request on basis of FIFO one by one 
-Request are of two types: Blocking(Sync task) and Non-Blocking(Async task)
-If the request is Non-Blocking, eventloop will process the request and send response to the user
-If the request in Blocking,request will go to thread pool and threadpool will assign a thread and make him work on request 
Note:Threadpool has limited number of threads
-When the thread will finish the request it will return the result and thread will return to Threadpool
